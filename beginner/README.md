# Solving the Cube - Beginner Method

## Background

This "beginner" method was conceived and created by Michael George - [2015GEOR02](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015GEOR02 "Official WCA Results")

* It is a simplified version of CFOP that can easily be taught to beginner cubers.

 - Cross
 - First Two Layers (F2L) - Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) - Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL)

* It is simple to learn and it also attempts to explain how / why the solution actually works.


## Summary

* Solve the cube using short “intuitive” sequences of moves (AKA “triggers”)
* Combine triggers to create simple “algorithms” which are easy to understand and remember
* Promote a “beginner” method which can be upgraded to “intermediate” and “advanced” methods
* Minimise the likelihood of messing up and having to redo earlier steps!## Links
