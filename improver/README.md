# Solving the Cube - Improver  Method

## Background

This "improver" method was conceived and created by Michael George - [2015GEOR02](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2015GEOR02 "Official WCA Results")

It is a simplified version of CFOP which builds upon the "beginner" method by the same author.


## Summary

### Beginner Method

* Massively simplified version of the CFOP method* Each of the 4 steps were split into 2 sub-steps - Cross – “Daisy” + “Cross” - F2L – Corners + Edges - OLL – Edge Orientation (EOLL) + Corner Orientation (OCLL) - PLL – Corner Permutation (CPLL) + Edge Permutation (EPLL)* Each sub-step was simplified to a single trigger / algorithm - The OLL algorithms were simple but near-optimal – F (U R U’ R’) F’ and beginner Anti-Sune - The PLL algorithms were simple but rather long – Anti-Sune and Niklas combinations* The simplicity of the “beginner” method makes it analogous to the “Bubble Sort” in computing - Do yourself a favor and upgrade it to the “improver” method!

### Improver Method

* Solve the cross directly, skipping the “Daisy” step which is only for beginners* Reduce the number of y / y’ rotations during F2L with 2 additional triggers* Reduce the number of moves and “looks” during OLL with 2 additional algorithms* Reduce the number of moves and “looks” during PLL with 2 additional algorithms
